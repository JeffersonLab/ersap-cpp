The ERSAP framework uses SOA to enhance the efficiency, agility, and
productivity of data processing applications. Services are the primary means
through which data processing logic is implemented. ERSAP application services
are running in a context that is agnostic to the global data processing
application logic. Services are loosely coupled and can participate in multiple
algorithmic compositions. Legacy processes or applications can also be presented
as services and integrated into a data processing application. Services can be
linked together and presented as one, complex, composite service. This framework
provides a federation of services, so that service-based data processing
applications can be united while maintaining their individual autonomy and
self-governance. ERSAP is a multilingual framework that supports services
written in Java, Python and C++ languages.
